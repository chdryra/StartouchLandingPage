          You have passion. You have opinions. You have a voice. Let it be heard! Whether it's your views on the ramen dish at that restaurant, the latest track from your favourite artist, 
		  last night's game or the political debate in the run up to the election, let your friends and followers know what you think.

        <p>
          Life is more than just a bunch of products and services - rate your experiences. How did that date go? How was your spin class? How was that exam or job interview? 
		  How well is your toddler eating? How excited are you about that upcoming sequel? How cool is that advert? How was your day?

          Your friends are the ones you trust the most. You also know their taste. If you're in town and you fancy a coffee or a meal, check out what your friends have previously reviewed nearby. 
		  Or you're looking to curl up with a good read and you know just the person whose opinion you trust, then check out their latest recommendations.

		Hi, my name is Riz, the guy working on Startouch!
		</p>
		<p>
		The idea for Startouch came about because I trust a single review from a friend far more than a bunch of anonymous reviews on the internet. I have friends whose opinions I trust in music, food, travel, films, recipes, 
		politics, sports and a bunch of other stuff. I wanted a single app that allowed me to follow all my friends' opinions in one pleace and that also recorded my opinions for future reference 
		(e.g. which meals I'd liked/disliked at a restaurant, which ingredients worked best in this recipe etc.). Twitter and Facebook are fine but they're too much of an unedited stream of conciousness. 
		I love the ease and immediacy of Instagram so wanted an app that was like that but for reviews. 
		</p>
		<p>
		So Startouch is kind of an "Instagram for Reviews". But it is so much more! It is a general way to record and share ratings. I mostly use it for reviewing stuff, but my wife, for example, 
		uses it to rate how her day went and how well our son is eating. If Twitter is a way to express yourself in 140 characters and Instagram is a way to express yourself using photos, 
		then Startouch is a way to express yourself using a score. What that score means is up to you :-)
		</p>
		<p>
		P.S. please excuse the janky look of the app - it's still very much a work in progress! Don't hesitate to contact me with feedback, ideas or if you want to help in some way :-)).
